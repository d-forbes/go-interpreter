# Go Interpreter

## Overview

This project is an interpreter written in Go, based on the book [Writing An Interpreter in Go by Thorsten Ball](https://interpreterbook.com/). I've chosen this project to further refine understanding of Go as a language and learn more about interpreters/parsing along the way.

The interpreter is implemented for the "Monkey Programming Language", a language that has been made up specifically for the purposes of this project. More info on the language [here](https://monkeylang.org/).

## Features

- **Fast Execution**: Leverages Go's efficiency for quick interpretation.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Runs on any platform that supports Go.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily add new features or expand language capabilities.
